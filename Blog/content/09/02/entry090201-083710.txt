VERSION|0.5.1|SUBJECT|We are back....|CONTENT|Well - 

We hope you are reading this as we are going to use this forum as our main method to pass on news and keep everyone up to date on TheVacationCalendar.com. 

It has been an interesting start to this website. We launched in late October and were pleased to see a fair response. Unfortunately, we broke a Google search rule and ended up getting banished from the internet. We made countless changes to the site in an effort to undo our error, but it cost us about 3 months. We are now finally back on page one of Google for the search term &quot;Vacation Calendar&quot;. Our SEO focus is now going to be to move up on the term &quot;Online Calendar&quot; which will prove to be an interesting challenge as we are currently not listed on the first 100 pages of Google for this term.

So, we are happy to be back. We hope to pick up where we left off. Thank you for those of you who helped TheVacationCalendar.com continue by referring your friends. We are looking into a way to reward you (and future referrers). Please keep an eye out for this under the category &quot;Specials&quot;.

Now, stop reading this and get back to planning your next vacation.
